# Creative Social Post Generator

A Flask application that generates quirky and creative social media posts using the Gemini AI API and a fun character profile, Mei Zhang (aka dancing_rakoonnn). The app supports random post generation based on predefined scenarios and maintains a circular buffer for posts.

## Features

- **Character Profile:** Customizes posts based on Mei Zhang's personality and interests.
- **Circular Buffer:** Limits the maximum number of stored posts to prevent memory issues.
- **Fallback Posts:** Uses predefined fallback posts if the API is unavailable.

- **Interactive Web UI:** Displays all generated posts in a user-friendly interface.
